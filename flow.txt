flow:

1. Grab list of current games.
2. Compare that to previous list of games (starts as [])
3. Compute created, deleted, modified.
4. Check modified against existing in-memory cache of games -> discord messages and update each message.
5. Check deleted against that cache and delete those messages and cache entries.
6. Create a new discord message per new game per subscription

schemas:

Subscriptions - All current subscriptions, including an autoincrement ID
Games - All current games, including an autoincrement ID
Message - Message ID + foreign keys for subscription and games ID

Deleting a subscription will automatically delete all messages
Deleting a game will automatically delete all messages.
